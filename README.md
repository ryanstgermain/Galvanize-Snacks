Your goal is to create a CRUD application to review and rate your favorite snacks at Galvanize! Draw on the topics you've learned from Q1 & Q2 to design and deploy an application that covers the desired user stories.

This repository is solely the backend of the project. You will need to build the frontend as well!

## User Stories

This repo includes some files to get you started, but it's up to you to finish these user stories:

- **User can view all snacks (already complete)**
  - When the user visits the homepage they see a list of all snacks


- **User can view details of an individual snack**
  - When the user clicks on a snack, display full information about that snack
  - Display list of reviews for snack
  - Display average rating of snack


- **User can signup a new account (registration)**
  - Display a form for the user to enter a name, email & password.
  - Clearly indicate registration success or failure to the user
  - The same email cannot be registered more than once


- **User can login with an existing account (authentication)**
  - Display a form for the user to enter an email & password.
  - Clearly indicate login success or failure to the user


- **User can post a review of a snack**
  - Display a form for the user to post a new review for a specific snack
  - If any information is missing when the user submits, surface an error
  - If everything is correct, bring them back to the snack's page to see their review
  - A visual clue should show the user which reviews are there own
  - Users may not post more than one review per snack

- **User can edit their own review of a snack**

  - Update seeds to make a new user an admin
  - When a user logs in and they are an admin, bring them to this page
  - Users who are not admins are redirected to the home page


- **Admins can create, update, and remove snacks**
  - Admin can add new snacks through this admin page
  - Admin can remove existing snacks through this admin page
  - Admin can edit existing snacks through this admin page


- **Admins can remove users**
  - Admin can remove users through the admin page
  - When a user is removed, all their reviews are deleted
  - Admins **cannot** remove other admins (or themselves)
